            Currently, I work at Microlins as a Sales Manager, where I oversee sales strategies and team performance to achieve our business goals. Before this role, I was a professional basketball player, which allowed me to develop strong teamwork, leadership, and strategic thinking skills. I'm currently studying Systems Analysis and Development degree at Celso Lisboa university, which gives me a unique perspective on integrating technology and business operations.
